# sam-wants-work

🧵 A creative job search project combining cross-stitch and code.  
This repository contains a GitHub Pages site I built to share a stitched job pitch in Bay Area coffee shops.

## About the Project

After submitting hundreds of job applications and receiving far fewer responses, I decided to try something more human, visible, and a little unexpected.

I stitched a simple message: *“Hiring? Ask me about my CV”*—and brought it to tech-heavy coffee shops around the Bay Area.

This repo hosts a small website with my CV, background, and links for anyone who followed the thread.
