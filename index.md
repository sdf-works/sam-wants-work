# 🧵 Sam Wants Work

👋 If you found this, that means it’s working—welcome! Thanks for following the thread (pun intended).

Hi! I'm **Sam Faulstich**—a PhD scientist, creative problem-solver, and Bay Area-based fiber artist. This is a stitched job pitch.

I'm a PhD chemical engineer specializing in atmospheric modeling, AI evaluation, and national security applications. I bring deep domain expertise to complex, data-driven problems—especially those at the intersection of environment, technology, and society.

## 🧵 Seen this in a coffee shop?

Yes—I stitched this job pitch by hand. Ask me about my CV!

After applying to hundreds of jobs (and hearing back from... not hundreds), I figured it was time to try something different. 
I literally stitched this message and brought it to tech-heavy coffee shops in San Francisco.

## 🎯 What I'm Looking For

Roles in:
- AI research and model evaluation

## 📍 Why Cross-Stitch?

Because I spend all day looking at computer models and it's so satisfying to make something tangible.  
Because I’ve stitched together models of wildfire smoke, combined different datasets to find improvements, and now… this project.
